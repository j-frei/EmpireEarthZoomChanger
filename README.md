# EmpireEarthZoomChanger

This tool changes the zoom distance for the games "Empire Earth" and its expansion pack "Empire Earth The Art of Conquest" by dynamically binary patching the executable.
The tool is built with C++ and Qt5.

## Recommended Values
For 1920x1080 resolution, I recommend the following values:
- Zoom: -40.5
- Cull: 55.0

## Releases
The latest `Github Actions`-based binaries (x32, i686) can be found at the [release page](https://github.com/j-frei/EmpireEarthZoomChanger/releases).
